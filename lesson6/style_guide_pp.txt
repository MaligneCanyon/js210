var title = "The Three-Body Problem";

// should use single quotes for strs


2.

var title = 'The Three-Body Problem',

    page_count = 400;

// should use sep var statement for each var
// should use camelCase for var names


3.

var completed = lastPageRead == 400;

// should use braces around complex assignment exprs
// should always use the strict equality op '==='


4.

if (finishedBook())

// should use single-line if statement, or use braces

read(400);

// should indent 2 spaces
// should have 1 space before and after '=' sign in initialization statement
// should have 1 space before and after '<' sign in conditional test
// should have 1 space before and after '+' sign in assignment
// should use explicit coercion when converting 'i' to str
// should declare all vars at the top of a fn
"the guide also recommends using named function expressions instead of function declarations:
var read = function read(pages) {
  ...
}" // ... pointless
